# HTML Frameworkd
## Introduction
A framework is a standardized set of concepts, practices and criteria for dealing with a common type of problem, which can be used as a reference to help us approach and resolve new problems of a similar nature. For a more straightforward, in the area of web design, a framework is defined as a package made up of a structure of files and folders of standardized code (HTML, CSS, JS documents etc.) which can be used to support the development of websites, as a basis to start building a site.
According to Bootstrap, HTML frameworks make front-end development faster and easier. There are many html framworks both open-source and proprietary. One notable open-source framework is Bootstrap. Bootstrap is well documented and has a wide coverage in blogs and tutorials. Cosists of the following:
HTML;
CSS;
JS; and
other external packags.
### Types of frameworks:
Bootstrap; Tuktuk; Foundation; Maerialize css; Golden Grid system;
Material design lite; Semantic; Pure CSS
Itis best to focus on one of many frameworks listed above and just be good at it. This is because some of these do clash such as trying to use Bootstrap and and Tuktuk, etc. As with many other technology tools, frameworks have documentations that have to be read carefully before fully benefiting from them. It is absolutely critical to read and understand the framework's documentations.
